Front Porch
You stand before the old, dark house, and feel a deep sense of dread as you watch a rocking chair move by itself.

Plant
Hasn't been watered in years, and crumbles to the touch. Pot may be useful though.

Smells like cookies, but flickering lights and insane amount of Christmas decorations give feelings of death.

Grandma's Bedroom
Maybe the scariest room in the house, full of unknowns. More clocks, more ticking.

Overwhelming smell and haze of old person perfume, grey hairs and lipsticks litter the counter.

Creepy Attic
Sense more than just cobwebs and antiques... she lurks about in the darkness.

So creepy and weird that it couldn't be made of just porcelain...

Not from this century & hasn't been fired in generations. Unpredictable.
