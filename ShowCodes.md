The code compiles and run as expected.

## Show Code #10 on 4/23 (3 of 4 points)

Code compiles and runs. I can drop my equipped item and it appears that another person can
then pick it up and equip it. The combat doesn't continue. It looks like I have to type
the kill command over and over again. That isn't user friendly. Also, if I type in just
kill, there is an exception. I did this in the terminal for the player who was attacked when
it said that my options were kill and flee. I just typed in kill and there was an exception.

## Show Code #11 on 4/25 (4 of 4 points)

Code compiles and runs. Shortest path appears to work, though there is one extra direction at the end
of the list when I try to go to the attic.
