## Motivation & Origin

This code is originally for a project in Dr. Mark Lewis's Principles of Computer Science II at Trinity University.  It is a text-based MUD in Scala with object-orientation and multithreading to contain an original storyline, world navigation, enemy NPCâ€™s, and item system. It also involves a basic networking system to allow for multi-player gaming where users can join and exit without breaking system, type into a chat, and engage in combat.
